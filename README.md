🚆 Germany Train Stations Map
A React-based interactive web application to visualize and explore German train stations on a Leaflet map with real-time search and filtering capabilities.

Frontend Assignment - PANTOhealth

🎯 Overview
This application fetches train station data from an API and displays them on an interactive map centered on Germany. Users can search stations by name or city, click on stations to view details, and interact with both the map and sidebar list seamlessly.

✨ Key Features
🗺️ Interactive Leaflet Map - All stations visualized with markers
🔍 Real-time Search - Filter stations by name or city with 300ms debouncing
📍 Station Selection - Click stations to highlight and auto-zoom on map
📱 Responsive Design - Optimized for mobile and desktop
⚡ Performance Optimized - Efficient filtering with React hooks and memoization
🧪 Unit Tested - Critical components tested with Vitest
🛠️ Tech Stack
React 18 with TypeScript
Leaflet + React-Leaflet for interactive maps
Tailwind CSS for styling
Vitest + React Testing Library for testing
Custom Hooks for state management
